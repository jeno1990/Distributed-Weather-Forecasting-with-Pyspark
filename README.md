Distributed Weather Forecasting
This project leverages Apache Spark and Hadoop to process and analyze large-scale weather data in a distributed environment.

Features
Distributed data processing using Apache Spark and Hadoop.
Scalable infrastructure for weather forecasting tasks.
Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

Python 3.7 or later
Apache Spark
Hadoop with HDFS
PySpark library
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Distributed-Weather-Forecasting.git
cd Distributed-Weather-Forecasting
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Update the core-site.xml and hdfs-site.xml files with the following properties:

core-site.xml
xml
Copy code
<property>
    <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
    <value>hdfs://0.0.0.0:9000</value>
</property>
<property>
    <name>hadoop.http.staticuser.user</name>
    <value>--username--</value>
</property>
hdfs-site.xml
xml
Copy code
<property>
    <name>dfs.namenode.rpc-bind-host</name>
    <value>0.0.0.0</value>
</property>
Start the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS):

bash
start-dfs.sh
Start the Spark master and worker nodes:

bash
start-all.sh
Setting Up the Data
Place the weather dataset in the HDFS directory:

bash
hdfs dfs -put /path/to/your/dataset.csv /hdfs/destination/path
Confirm the file has been uploaded to HDFS:

bash
Copy code
hdfs dfs -ls /hdfs/destination/path
Running the Project
Start a Jupyter Notebook server or run the script:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the notebook weather_forcast_big_data.ipynb.

Execute the cells in order to initialize Spark, process the data, and run analysis.
